- 👋 Hi, I’m @hostageDev
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and learning!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, CSS, HTML and I'm gonna be starting on GDscript/C# soon.
- 💞️ This page is for me and my wonderful girlfriend to hopefully easily make some games together!
- 📫 The easiest way to reach me is through discord: 'hostagetmt'.
